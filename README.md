## Introductions
A relic mod I wrote for a friend that enjoys randomness in video games. The player's starting relic is replaced with
the Gremlin's Dice which at the end of each combat provides the player with a benefit or drawl back.

This was sort of an after thought to the mod I wrote before this
https://github.com/Pandatron76/StsMod_Clawfect

At the end of each combat a die is cast.  
&nbsp;On a 1, the player gains 5 max hp.  
&nbsp;On a 2, the player loses 5 max hp.  
&nbsp;On a 3, the player gains 15 gold.  
&nbsp;On a 4, the player loses 15 gold.  
&nbsp;On a 5, the player upgrades a random card in their deck.  
&nbsp;Last but not least on a 6, the player obtains a curse.
